# Facebook Scripts

### How to use the "delete" scripts:
1. Head over to https://facebook.com/<YOUR_NICKNAME>/allactivity (Or `Settings & Privacy` -> `Activity Log`)
2. Open Inspect Element (`F12` or `CTRL + SHIFT + I`). 
3. Copy the code to the console tab.
4. Edit any options that may appear to the specifications of the page. (for example some options on the page only have `Recycle Bin`, whereas others have `Delete`)
5. Run the code. Sometimes you may have to tweak some timings, as Fakebook has some pretty shady rate limits. You may also want to refresh every so often and run the code again.
